This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that creates a dangling pointer by modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer after the vector has gone out of scope. This leads to undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safe way to handle the situation using references or smart pointers.
